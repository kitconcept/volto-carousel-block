> [!WARNING]
> This add-on is meant to be used in combination with the [volto-light-theme](https://github.com/kitconcept/volto-light-theme). If you plan to use this add-on with plain Volto you will have to write your own styles for it. You can use the existing ones via manual import like this `import "@kitconcept/volto-carousel/theme/_main.scss"` or as reference.

## Compatibility

| version | Volto version | VLT version |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| 1.x.x       |   >=Volto 18.20.0  | >= 7.0.0-alpha.1 |

## Features

The `@kitconcept/volto-carousel-block` allows editors to add a carousel to a Volto page.

### Looping Behavior (`allowLoop` Setting)
The `allowLoop` setting controls whether looping can be enabled for individual blocks across the site.

- **When `allowLoop` is set to `true`**:
Each block will display a checkbox that allows you to enable or disable looping for that specific block individually.

- **When `allowLoop` is set to false (or omitted)**:
Looping is completely disabled across the entire site. No loop checkboxes will be shown, and blocks cannot be looped.

Make sure to set `allowLoop` to `true` if you want to allow users to toggle looping behavior for specific blocks like this:

```json
config.blocks.blocksConfig.carousel = {
  ...config.blocks.blocksConfig.carousel,
  allowLoop: true,
};
```

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.

### Volto 18 and later

Add `@kitconcept/volto-carousel-block` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-carousel-block": "*"
}
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-carousel-block` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@kitconcept/volto-carousel-block'];
```


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```shell
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @kitconcept/volto-carousel-block
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-carousel-block` to your package.json:

```json
"addons": [
    "@kitconcept/volto-carousel-block"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-carousel-block": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```shell
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```shell
yarn start
```


## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).
